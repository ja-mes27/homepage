        <div class="subflex"><article> I coded the aforementioned robot in Python. I controlled the robot with a Raspberry Pi that I loaded Linux onto. I would SSH to the PI from remote desktop to write the code. I mostly followed a tutorial that explained what to do, but not so much why I was doing it. I researched all the code to understand what it did and why it worked, and learned a lot. I also set up a home cloud server on another Raspberry Pi through similar means.</article></div>

        <div class="subflex"><article> I started learning HTML and CSS last week and I've learned a lot! I'm having great fun and I feel like I'm getting a good grasp of it. I initially learned from Net Ninja on youtube, and use W3 Schools for reference. I created this website from scratch without any templates. I've got work to do, especially in making it more responsive but I know where to go from here.</article></div>

    <p class="subtitle">I also understand the basics of Git and Github. After I upload this website I plan to move onto Javascript. I've already watched a couple tutorials and really like the look of how logical and versatile it seems to be.

    <p class="subtitle">Thank you for reading my application! Please reach out on my work email if there's anything else you would like to know. I look forward to hearing back from you! Whether I'm sucessful or not, I've already learned so much and had a lot of fun, and for that I am truly grateful.</p>
